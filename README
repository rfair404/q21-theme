The Q21 theme is a minimalist WordPress theme framework inspired by the html5 boilerplate concept. It uses Modernizr and jQuery to make old browsers behave and is intended to provide a clean starting point for designers wishing to create custom WordPress themes. 

Many of the libraries including the Modernizr and hthm5boilerplate.css were ported from the html5 boilerplate project. 

The theme itself contains 4 widget positions and 4 menus. It also supports custom backgrounds and post formats. 

Enjoy!
